What is SNAPPy
##############

SNAPPy is a Snakemake pipeline for HIV-1 subtyping by phylogenetic pairing. It was build to allow locaal high-throughput HIV-1 subtyping while being resource efficient and scalable. This pipeline was constructed using `Snakemake <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_ , and it uses `MAFFT <https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/>`_ for multiple sequence alignments, `BLAST <https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs>`_ for similarirty queries, `FastTree <http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/>`_ for phylogenetic inference, and several `Biopython <https://biopython.org/>`_ modules for data parsing an analysis. For in-depth information on how the tool works please visit the :ref:`how_it_works` section. SNAPPy was design for Linux based operative systems.
