# SNAPPy

This is the repository for SNAPPy,a Snakemake pipeline for HIV-1 subtyping by phylogenetic pairing. SNAPPy allows high-throughput HIV-1 subtyping locally while being resource efficient and scalable. This pipeline was constructed using Snakemake , and it uses MAFFT and for multiple sequence alignment, BLAST for similarirty querys, FastTree for phylogenetic inference, and several Biopython modules for data parsing an analysis. For in-depth information on how the tool works please visit the [documentation page](https://snappy-hiv1-subtyping.readthedocs.io) . SNAPPy was design for Linux based operative systems.
